The Lightning Laplace Solver is a Matlab code that
solves the Laplace equation on a polygon or circular
polygon with Dirichlet or homogeneous Neumann
boundary conditions, typically in a fraction of a second.
By default it has 6-digit accuracy
all the way up to the corners despite the singularities
there, assuming the boundary data are continuous.
For most problems the computation
continues to be successful if
the tolerance is tightened to 8 or 10 digits.

To learn how to run the code, type
<tt>help laplace</tt> and note the examples
displayed there.  Also execute <tt>examples</tt>.
<p>

<tt>confmap</tt> is a companion to <tt>laplace</tt>
for computing conformal maps of simply-connected domains.
Type <tt>help confmap</tt> for information and examples.
To use <tt>confmap</tt>, you must have

<p>

<tt>laplace</tt> and <tt>confmap</tt> get their speed and accuracy from the
representation of harmonic and analytic functions in terms of rational
function with poles exponentially clustered near the corners.
(The mathematics is related to the reason lightning strikes at
sharp corners.)

<tt>laplace</tt> is restricted to polygons and circular polygons,
but the algorithm is also 
effective for exterior or unbounded domains, multiply connected
domains, and domains with more general boundary arcs.
Later versions of
the code will allow for such variations, as well as extensions to
biharmonic and Helmholtz problems.  See
